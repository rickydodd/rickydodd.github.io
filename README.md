# Ricky Dodd

The repository for my personal portfolio website.

## Technologies

Current technologies employed by my portfolio website itself:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - Used to create a build and deploy pipeline.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  - Used as a build tool for hot reloading, and for managing plugins for minifying and polyfilling.
